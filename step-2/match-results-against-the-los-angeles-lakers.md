# Match results against the Lakers

LeGoat in there so you lost no doubt

The Score was 177-43

Recommendation: **Get better**

You fought hard, but the game did not go your way. The Lakers were on fire, and despite your best efforts, the final score was a tough one to swallow (In simpler terms, you got humiliated).
